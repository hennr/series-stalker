![master](https://github.com/hennr/series-stalker/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

A playground project to answer the question "what is the next air date of <your favorite tv show here>"

If you have the same problem answering that question drop me a line, I may add accounts in the future.

## Development

For local development start the program via spring-boot-maven-plugin:

    mvn spring-boot:run

If working on the front-end code start the parcel watch mode, after the spring-boot:run, to get your changes hot reloaded in the browser:

    ./yarn watch
